## 🚀 Key Features

* **Responsive Dashboard** - Shows overall average scoring progress, total interviews completed, and crutch filler words tracking. Uses **Chart.js** to show progression line charts and subscore radar graphs.
* **Simulated Interview Room** - Complete with simulated camera overlays, active question teleprompter widgets, real-time timer readouts, and active visual voice wave pulses.
* **Built-in Speech-to-Text** - Uses the browser's native **Web Speech API** (`SpeechRecognition`) to transcribe answers in real-time, completely free of charge. Includes a manual text editor fallback.
* **Text-to-Speech Question Readout** - Reads the active interview questions out loud using the browser's synthesis engines.
* **AI Feedback Evaluator** - Grades each question response out of 100 on **Clarity**, **Grammar**, and **Relevance**. Generates bulleted lists of specific Strengths, Improvement Areas, and Actionable Tips.
* **Modular Grading Engine** - Runs immediately out of the box using a local rule-based NLP simulator. Can easily be updated to run full LLM evaluations using a Gemini API Key!
* **Resume Analysis & Q&A** - Upload PDF/DOCX/TXT resumes to generate personalized interview questions based on your experience. Ask AI questions about your resume during the interview.
* **SQLite Persistence** - Keeps record history logs of all past mock interview sessions, questions, and detail results.
* **Anti-Cheat Monitoring** - Detects when users switch tabs during interview sessions.
* **Achievement System** - Unlock milestones as you complete practice sessions.

## 💻 Setup & Installation

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, or Safari recommended for Speech-to-Text features)

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd mock-ai-interview

# Install backend dependencies
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

### 3. Initialize Database

```bash
# Initialize SQLite and seed mock questions
python backend/database.py
```

This creates `backend/interview.db` with pre-seeded interview questions for:
- Software Engineer
- Product Manager
- Data Analyst
- Sales Executive
- Marketing Manager
- HR Manager
- Financial Analyst
- Operations Manager
- And more...

### 4. Run the Flask Backend

```bash
# Start the API server
python backend/app.py
```

The server will run at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### 5. Launch the Frontend

Open `frontend/index.html` directly in your browser, or serve it via:

```bash
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

## 🔑 Optional: Enable Gemini AI Grading

By default, the application uses a rule-based NLP grading engine. To enable advanced Gemini AI evaluation:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   copy .env.example .env
   ```

2. Add your Gemini API key to `.env`:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

3. Restart the Flask server. The application will automatically detect the key and use Gemini for feedback.
